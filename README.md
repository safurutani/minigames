# Minigames

This project allows the user to play 3 different minigames within the console. They menu is presented in a numbered list and allows user input. The games call for user input which either come in the form of numbers to choose between options or, in the case of rock, paper, scissors, words indicating the option chosen. Each of these games can be played over and over as they keep track of scores. If the user does not wish to play again, entering "n", or really anything other than "y", it exits the game and brings them back to the main menu. From there they can quit the program entirely if they are done playing.


## Guess the number

The user gets to configure what number range will be used. Then the computer randomly picks a number and prompts the user to guess. With each guess, the computer will tell the user whether their guess is too high or too low in an effort to guide the guesses. It keeps track of how many guesses it takes to win.

## Rock, Paper, Scissors

The user must type one of the three options. The computer randomly picks one. Upon the user entering their choice, the match up will be displayed and the score of computer vs. player will follow.

## High/Low

This game is another simple guessing game. There are a total of 10 possible cards to choose from. The computer draws 2 cards at random. It will draw the first one and tell the user what it is. The user must then guess if the subsequent card that the computer randomly picks is higher or lower than the initial card.
